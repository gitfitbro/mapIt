# MapIt 

## Why not save a coulpe seconds out of your day?

I am usually finding myself needing to copying addresses and needing to open them in google maps. Which takes the following steps:

* Highlight the address
* Copy the address
* Open the web browser 
* Go to https://maps.google.com/
* Click the address text field
* Paste the address
* Press ENTER

Who has time for all that??

It could be as simple as this with mapIt.py

* Highlight the address
* Copy the address
* Run mapIt.py

Would love to improve and open to feedback :)
